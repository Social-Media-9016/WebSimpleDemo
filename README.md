## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **Libraries**: emoji-picker-react, date-fns, Material-UI

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Log In?

- Confirm that your username and password are correct
- Check your network connection
- Verify that the Firebase configuration is correct

### Image Upload Failed?

- Confirm that the image size does not exceed the limit (5MB for posts, 2MB for comments)
- Check your network connection
- Verify that Firebase Storage rules are configured correctly

### Emoji Selector Not Displaying?

- Confirm that the emoji-picker-react library is installed
- Check if your browser supports modern JavaScript features

### npm Dependency Installation Failed?

- Check the `requirements.txt` file for specific versions of all dependencies
- Try installing dependencies one by one to identify which one is causing the issue
- Verify that your Node.js and npm versions meet the requirements

## Data Security

This application uses Firebase security rules to protect user data. Only logged-in users can create content, and users can only modify or delete their own content.
